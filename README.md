# WiinUPro

WiinUPro was started by KeyPuncher [here](https://github.com/KeyPuncher/WiinUPro).

This fork aims to replace the older SCP driver used in the original project with the newer ViGEm bus. The SCP driver can cause complications with other inputs while the newer ViGEm bus avoids these issues and is used by many current controller emulation projects.
